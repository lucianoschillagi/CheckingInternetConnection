/*
 Here's a breakdown of the code:

 @Observable:
 The @Observable annotation typically indicates that this class can be observed for changes in one of its properties. It's not a standard Swift attribute, and its exact behavior may depend on the specific framework or library it's part of.

 class NetworkMonitor:
 This line defines a Swift class named NetworkMonitor.

 Properties and Initializers:

 private let networkMonitor = NWPathMonitor(): This creates an instance of NWPathMonitor, which is part of Apple's Network framework. It's used to monitor network path changes, such as when the device connects to a network, disconnects, or changes from cellular to Wi-Fi, and vice versa.
 private let workerQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "Monitor"): This is a private DispatchQueue named "Monitor." It's used for handling tasks related to monitoring the network path. In this code, it's used to perform network monitoring on a separate queue to avoid blocking the main thread.
 var isConnected = false: This is a boolean property that will be used to store the current network connectivity status. It is initially set to false.
 init():
 This is the class's initializer, and it's called when an instance of NetworkMonitor is created. Inside the initializer:

 networkMonitor.pathUpdateHandler: This is a closure that gets executed whenever the network path status changes. It takes the path parameter, which contains information about the current network path.
 self.isConnected = path.status == .satisfied: In the closure, it checks if the path's status is equal to .satisfied, and if it is, it sets the isConnected property to true. This indicates that the device has an active and satisfied network connection.
 networkMonitor.start(queue: workerQueue): This starts the network monitoring process using the NWPathMonitor. It specifies the workerQueue to handle the network path updates.
 Overall, this code defines a NetworkMonitor class that uses the NWPathMonitor to monitor network connectivity status. When the network path status changes, it updates the isConnected property, which can be observed for changes in a SwiftUI or similar framework to reflect network connectivity changes in the user interface.
